== Welcome
I am an Associate Researcher with the Frontier Research Center in the Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China, since 2021. I received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D.  degrees in EE from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China in 2012, the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China in 2015, and the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada in 2019, respectively. I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the ECE Department in the University of Waterloo from 2019 to 2021. My research interests include 6G networks, network intelligence, and network virtualization. \n
